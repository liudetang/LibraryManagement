This app is based on source code available in David Sulc's book on structuring backbone with require.js. Please refer https://github.com/davidsulc/structuring-backbone-with-requirejs-and-marionette for orginal source code. The orginal code demostrates a contact manager application and this repo shows a small library management app..
This is already stated here:https://github.com/srihari-sridharan/LibraryManagementUnMinified/blob/master/app/js/modules/about/show/templates/message.html

About Library Manager
This application was developed to help me learn the patterns and practices used by David Sulc in his book 'Structuring Backbone Application Using Require JS and Marionette Modules'.
Mission Accomplished!
